# AHMM_mouse_trajectories

Code to run Autoregressive Hidden Markov Model (AHMM) on longitudinal data of weight incorporating age, sex, and APOE genotype to identify emergent weight trajectories and phenotypes. 

Results are saved in the result folder

Run 
1- runAHMM_1.m to run 10 times the AHMM 
2 - analyzeTrajectories_2.m to select the model with max trace and analyze the trajectories based on the transition matrix
